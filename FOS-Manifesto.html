            This vision is inspired by “The Future of Science” panel hosted by the MCB 15 course, taught by Prof. John Matsui, addressing the public understanding of science. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Our three panelists include Robert Full, professor from the department of Integrative Biology, Eva Harris, professor from Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, and David Jay, the CEO of Journal Lab, a revolutionary online discussion platform for scientists to interact with primary source publications from PubMed (a major search engine for peer-reviewed scientific literature). Each panelist shares unique perspectives that, together, corroborate a similar revolutionary vision of the future of science and education. We will address some benefits and limitations of this vision as it unfolded in the discussion, and we will then suggest some themes in order to spur the proper courses of action. The readers of this article are encouraged to collectively contribute their own ideas as well.

        <header>PDF: Pusillanimous Dissemination Failure?</header>
        <section class="inside">
            <p>
            This issue will be revisited in various contexts throughout this article. David Jay addressed an underlying problem that I did not even consider until it was brought to my attention:

            "We need to kill the PDF. So long as science is wrapped up in little stories that are difficult to link and difficult to extract the data from, it's going to be very difficult to make it readable to a range of audiences. We need a world of data floating around out there, a world of analytical methods for that data floating around out there, and a world of storytellers who are weaving it all together. Those don't have to be the same people. If it's easy to aggregate diverse data and analytics to tell your story, it'll be [easier] to tell stories that make sense both inside and outside of your field." –E-mail exchange prior to MCB 15 panel
            </p>
            <p>
            Before PDF aficionados jump on the defense and suggest trying alternative PDF viewers, allow me to first express praise for what the Portable Document Format has done for us. Thanks to the PDF, a dense and concise story with objective data that has been rigorously peer-reviewed by experts in the field is storable, searchable, and sharable. This is fantastic for printing.
            </p>
            <p>
            The problem goes deeper than the PDF really, to the very concept of printing as a best practice for disseminating information. The very act of printing removes the document from the "internetwork." Any critiques or accolades bestowed on the printed document must be outside the document – themselves printed documents on which printed responses can be written. In the current instantiation of each writing as its own independent object, the result is a pile of separate documents branching like a tree, with many limbs out of reach or even sight when reading the original document at the trunk. If we accept that comments on the original are important additions – be they criticisms, suggestions, or thoughts on the work’s implications – then we should want those addenda to be as visible and searchable as the work itself. After all, what a loss it would be if when experts took the time to foment and share their opinions, very few knew where to read them. Yet this is arguably our current standard. Worse, the trunk of this tree we so want to explore is often guarded by a seemingly arbitrary and heavily tolled gate. With the internet, it is now cheap and easy to publish dynamic documents - like this one -, so why do we still have archaic printing and access problems for primary literature? On a more interactive <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">platform</a>, like what we see on reddit and wikipedia for example, an open discussion would enable researchers and collaborators to learn from one another, and have the branches that emerge be easy to find and followWe can and should have dynamic and interesting interactions with primary literature. Journal Lab is one example of the emerging market working to enable this.
            </p>
        </section>
        <footer class="summary"> 
            In summary: PDF is static, cold media that is neither fun nor engaging. Alternative platforms we can consider, like Journal Lab and platforms facilitating access to working papers, will promote access and dynamic interactions at every stage of the scientific publication cycle, making knowledge easier to find, explore, and contribute to.

            Unification of the Division: Cycles of Knowledge, Publication, and Access
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>
            There has been very little notable development scientific publication cycle from what was depicted over a decade ago (1999) in a University of Washington course. Ironcially, 1999 was the year Web 2.0 was coined, suggesting a restricting of the internet towards interactive collaborations and away from static web pages. A change that has been very successful outside of academic publishing. The knowledge cycle feeds into the publication cycle, which ultimately feeds into the access cycle. Humanistic departments may find relatable aspects. The figure below is an adaption done by the University of New Brunswick with specific examples of interfaces for “exchange” in science:
            </p>
            <p>
            Wikipedia is becoming an interface that allows more dynamic interactions with knowledge and real-time evaluation of the quality of the topic of interest as it is portrayed. This shortens the delay in the transition from knowledge to access—a step in the right direction. “Peer-Review” is open to anyone, and fact-checking with primary literature is still encouraged, especially in the context of academia.
            </p>
            <p>
            "A lot has changed in scientific communication in just the past two years. We've seen the UK and the EU pass open access mandates, the blockage of SOPA and the Research Works Act really draw a line in the sand here in the states, and the rapidly increasing movement of major players like Nature and Elsevier towards new business models. On the business side it seems like everyone's accepted that open access is going to become the dominant paradigm, and companies are trying to position themselves to hold key roles in the new ecosystem." –David Jay in an e-mail exchange prior to the panel.

            Current Model for Scientific Research Progress
        </header>

        <section>
            <p>
            This is a generalized diagram of the current model for progress in scientific research:
            </p>
            <p>
            This model is reinforced by the concept of scarcity (i.e. limited funding resources).
            </p>
            <p>
            Collaboration involves providing feedback. In our current model, feedback is not incentivized. Feedback benefits an individual researcher, and since this researcher is likely to be your competitor for funding, it is not to your short-term personal advantage to provide feedback (see Game Theory). “[There is] a huge waste of resources from lack of collaboration,” David Jay laments in the MCB 15 panel discussion.

            Future of Scientific Discourse and Education
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>
            The following is a schematic for the potential future of scientific discourse and education. In this future, researchers and groups are no longer confined to work through the entire process relatively isolated from others. Instead the structure can be moved around freely, allowing researchers to find different niches in the system and potentially contribute in specific capacities across many projects rather than necessarily in all capacities for the limited few with which they are identified. It is an open structure that does not confine but encourages exploration:
            </p>

            Prof. Full discusses tenure evaluation in the context of the reward structure. Why is this person not selected to be the leader in the field for an international, inter-disciplinary collaboration? Once this style of evaluation starts to happen, the reward structure will change. It ties in with industry and education as well. “When I started, self-promotion wasn’t a big thing…now you’re required to communicate. If you don’t communicate outside of your discipline…people won’t know who you are.” Prof. Full harnesses the dissemination power of TED talks to communicate broadly, beyond collaborators and to the general public. By engaging the public in his subject of expertise more broadly, Prof. Full ameliorates public understanding. (Check out his TED profile and videos.)

            The following section on education considers possible avenues for students to self-promote while engaging in scientific discourse.

            If you are passionate about education, and you haven’t experienced the narration of Sir Ken Robinson visualized by RSAnimate, Changing Education Paradigms, take 11 minutes and 41 seconds for some thought-provoking perspective on the topic.
        </aside>
        <section>
            <p>
            The Future of Science panel appropriately addressed the changes envisioned for education: “I have worked on both the research end of the collaborations as well as the education end,” starts Prof. Full, “We argue that you have to train people explicitly to do this…Interdisciplinary training is required. We first made a big mistake in doing it, which is we said, ‘You all have to do all the disciplines. You know, you’re a biologist, [so] you have to know something about math, something about chemistry’…That was a total failure. Although you’re a very interesting person, you’re a jack of all trades, master of none. You can’t contribute to any inter-disciplinary collaboration, and so you’re not valuable.” Prof. Full shares the concept of mutualistic teaming, where students training in different fields can translate curiosity-based discovery into real products: “You have a deep expertise, but we explicitly teach you how to contribute to and benefit from the other discipline.” Prof. Full motivates biologists and engineers to work together in a teaching lab to do original research. “Last year we had one of those studies in the teaching lab end up on the cover of Nature, so we’re really convinced that this is a good model.”
            </p>
            <p>
            The unification of research and teaching stimulates exploration and discovery, instead of evaluating content memorization and delivery (engorgement and regurgitation).
            </p>
            <p>
            The scientific publication cycle (as aforementioned) shows how education in our current model has only a superficial and passive interaction with this process. Before the university level, students have limited access to textbooks, i.e. classical texts of modern education systems. Most texts synthesize background information and present it as dogma. Students highlight and summarize, separating themselves from the text the way tourists superficially engage with their surroundings through a camera lens, disengaging from the opportunity to experience a new culture.
            </p>
            <p>
            Some college courses promote critical thinking. Students begin to gain access to the primary peer-reviewed literature and think critically about it. After students struggle to re-digest the predigested PDF, great discussions and critiques come out of these courses. Students should be encouraged to share their “reviews” on an open-interface, where other students and researchers can learn from one another.
            </p>
            <p>
            This allows academic “peer-review” and learning to interact in meaningful ways. (See Feedback and Feedforward section for additional details)
            </p>
            <p>
            A similar interface can be implemented at any grade level as a meta-pedagogical* practice. Why not have 3rd graders share with one another their questions for the science fair project before they even start it, and reflect on their progress along the way? Teachers can archive these projects, and future students can repeat experiments (replication) or address questions that were left unanswered by the work of previous students, building on a pre-existing discourse. Students can individually build digital portfolios, and this practice can extend through the high school level. Why not have students share the theses statements of their English essays on an open source, and students can provide incentivized feedback for one another along the way? Students that share a similar interest can delve into a topic together and collaborate to produce an essay to be included in their public portfolio. This portfolio can become a foundation for meaningful discourse at university-level academic engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
            Teachers are confronted regularly with a question that only brave, impugning students put forward: “What’s the point?” While we could dance around an answer that entertains the idea of, “You will learn from this experience, so you can one day engage in a meaningful discourse,” I propose that students be given the opportunity to actively engage and contribute to the academic discourse now. Students want to have a purpose, and we have the technology to enable it, so what are we waiting for?
            </p>

        <header>Closing  Opening Statements</header>
        <section>
            <p>
            The conceived concept of an “idea” as something that is made and shared with the community, instead of being had and owned by an individual, is an important consideration. There exists an element of scarcity imbedded in the notion of ownership. Not enough money, not enough faculty positions, not enough Noble Prizes for every individual, and since good ideas can be incorporated as capital in our current model of self-marketing, (we “sell” ourselves and our ideas), we are inclined to ensconce them as our own private property to fabricate our self-worth. We want to increase our self-worth as much as possible because in our system, as it stands, our “value” is assessed by the people deciding to whom these limited resources (money and jobs) will be partitioned. An idea does not have value, however, until others attribute value to it. It gains value the more it is disseminated and developed, and from it can the fruiting bodies of other new ideas grow.
            </p>
            <p>
            We are imbedded in a world constructed from the ideas of others, from the computers we use to the words we abuse. Collectively, we would not be where we are today if these resources, designed and shared by others, were not available. Aspects of how we currently disseminate knowledge in academia delay use of new ideas and resources by others, and this stalled feedback stalls progress. Peer-review is a meaningful advancement that maintains the quality of disseminated knowledge, so acclaimed experts in the field who have survived the process themselves can preserve this system, though the process is slow and laborious. We can consider sharing data and ideas in real-time instead. Those who wish to fully develop the quality of their work can submit it to be reviewed by peers and receive a “gold-star” in the community.  Technology is enabling us to open source ideas and data as resources for others, and this is definitely a step in the right direction. We can develop even further if we open the review process to everyone. Some may express concern that not everyone is qualified to review an experiment. Unique questions and perspectives from those who share interests in the field, especially if they come from outside the field, could only lead to novel and exciting developments.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is often said that great things are reached by standing on the shoulders of giants. We need to start thinking about how to hoist the most people up onto those shoulders. If we all benefit from better science and faster progress, and if we can use technology to make the hoisting process as easy and painless as possible, then maybe we can overcome some of the limits put in place by our current insular, short-term competition model. It’s worth pushing for, because while game theory explains the emergence of competition as we know it, it also demonstrates the co-opetition brings all the players to a higher score on average. Aspects of our current reward structure acknowledge mere individuals, imposing competition and clamoring that will only keep our community at a ground-level stalemate. It would be more productive for communities, not individuals, to receive accolades for their accomplishments. The problem going forward is finding ways to restructure insentive so that the individuals that make up our communities want to help each other more and fight each other less.
            </p>
            <p>
            Imagine a world where collaboration surpassed competition.  A socio-ecologically balanced system of co-evolving engineers and biologists, chemists and computer scientists, astrophysicists and artists, and interplay between the groups of these experts, all sharing an objective vernacular and each contributing to the development and dissemination of novel ideas and discoveries. Across groups, there are sub-groups collecting data, others interpreting raw data with diverse statistical and intellectual analyses, storytellers that take these analyses and describe them with narrations, novelists that weave the stories together with cross-disciplinary comparisons*, and performers that symbolically reinterpret these stories and uniquely transform them in ways that strengthen the links in this non-linear, rhizomatic chain, even making new and constructive kinks in the links. This is the future of science as we see it, and maybe, dare I be so blunt, humanity—if we are lucky.
