        Explore the boundaries of imagination extending beyond bureaucratic constraints, and let us plan for the future of information sharing. The ideas presented here are not original, but they have yet to be developed and implemented. The overarching theme is accessibility in the context of future scientific discourse.

        <section class=contextulizer>
            <p>
            Our three panelists were <a href="http://ib.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/fullr">Robert Full</a>, professor of Integrative Biology, <a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/faculty/harris.php">Eva Harris</a>, professor from Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, and <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgljay">David Jay</a>, the CEO of <a href="http://www.journallab.org/">Journal Lab</a>, a revolutionary online discussion platform for scientists to interact with primary source publications from PubMed (a major search engine for peer-reviewed scientific literature). Each panelist shared unique perspectives that, together, corroborated a similar revolutionary vision of the future of science and education. We will address some benefits and limitations of this vision as it unfolded in the discussion, and we will then suggest some themes in order to spur the proper courses of action. The readers of this article are encouraged to collectively contribute their own ideas as well.

            Before diving into a rabbit hole, the mode this information is being conveyed is certainly not an example for the way we envision how ideas will be conveyed as the future discussed here unfolds. We hope our writing and discussions that arise from it will contribute to this transformation. </p><p>
            Ideally, readers of this article (yes, you) will provide <b><i>feedback</i></b> on this model using the current format available. <a href="http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu">It is a blog</a>, <b>comment</b>. Comment on comments. Early developmental stages are a time for exploring the possibilities, so thought exercises are interspersed in the article. <b><i>Think and talk about it.</i></b> If you think of simple answers to some of these complex issues, please share. If everyone shines the flashlight of his/her perspective on this issue, we will have a better idea of problems and solutions to anticipate once inside the rabbit hole.

    <header>Knowledge, Publication, and Access</header>
    <section>
    <p>
    In academia, the modern knowledge cycle shares an increasingly frustrating similarity to the process decades ago. More or less isolated researchers work on independent projects, write up the results as a single static product, buy print space from a journal, and have this pruned piece of their findings published for all of the readers of that specific journal to find and digest. In the process there is a great deal of loss, both of unpublished data and of unreached but potentially interested audiences. Yes, initiatives like PubMed have made journals more searchable, but the basic cycle of data generation, data pruning, and then the limited sharing to spur future data generation is still, for all intents and purposes, the unilateral model of information sharing in academic science. Because of this, data shared in other media is often not included in data bases like PubMed, and certainly not recognized by the vast majority of assessing agencies deciding grant allocation or promotion. Thus the publication cycle fuels itself despite its antiquated shortcomings, creating at once an obvious need to change these cycles, and a strong short-term motivation in most academics not to.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <b>knowledge</b> cycle feeds into the <b>publication</b> cycle, which ultimately feeds into the <b>access</b> cycle. Humanistic departments may find relatable aspects. The figure below is an example by the <a href="http://www.unb.ca/">University of New Brunswick</a> with specific examples for interface "exchange" in science:
    </p>
    <div id=cyclepastimg><img src="img/PastCycle.png"/></div>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is becoming an interface that allows more dynamic interactions with knowledge and real-time evaluation of the quality of the topic of interest as it is portrayed. This shortens the delay in the transition from knowledge to access-a step in the right direction. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-review">Peer-Review</a> is open to anyone, and fact-checking with primary literature is still encouraged, especially in the context of academia. David Jay observes that the current model in academia is beginning to parallel how we see information disseminated in non-academic discourse:
    </p>
    <p>
    <i>"A lot has changed in scientific communication in just the past two years. We've seen the UK and the EU pass open access mandates, the blockage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">SOPA</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Works_Act">Research Works Act</a> really draw a line in the sand here in the states, and the rapidly increasing movement of major players like Nature and Elsevier towards new business models. On the business side it seems like everyone's accepted that open access is going to become the dominant paradigm, and companies are trying to position themselves to hold key roles in the new ecosystem." </i>-David Jay in an e-mail exchange prior to the panel.

    <article>
    <header>CULTURE OF THE UNIVERSITY</header>
    <section class=contextualizer>
        <p>
        Feedback benefits an individual researcher, and since this researcher is likely to be your competitor for funding, it is not to your short-term personal advantage to provide feedback (see Game Theory). "[There is] a huge waste of resources from lack of collaboration," David Jay laments in the MCB 15 panel discussion. 
        This model is maintained by the culture of the university.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b><i>"The hardest thing to change is the culture of the university,"</i></b>adds Prof. Harris, "I have done a lot of collaborations with engineering, bioengineering, etc. It is much easier to communicate in different tongues, Espa&ntilde;ol, Fran&ccedil;ois, than it is to be cross-disciplinary!" When different nations, i.e. departments, are open to outsiders learning their <i>tongue</i>, a new relationship is created in the form of a collaboration; however, there is a certain amount of exclusivity imposed by excessive jargon in the sciences. It can be intimidating, and not everyone feels comfortable hearing accents (e.g. different uses of technical terms usually used by an exclusive community).
        </p>
        <p>
        Prof. Full, upon receiving funding from National Science Foundation when he started at Berkeley in the Integrative Biology department, collaborated with the engineering department and a private company: "There was very little communication. There was no vocabulary to talk about things, yet we saw the possibilities." The learning curve is higher than it has to be, and researchers that are interested in only a particular aspect of an outside discipline should not have to start from the level of a broad undergraduate course to reach the level of mastery required to communicate within the other discipline. <b>Minimizing jargon will facilitate the bridging of multiple disciplines</b>. "Science is moving in the direction where cutting-edge research has to be interdisciplinary-the problem is, how do you create a model to do it effectively?" posits Prof. Full. The details of the model proposed by Prof. Full are addressed in the Education section of this article.

    <article>
	<header><i>Moving from PDF to an Open Platform</i></header>
	<section class=contextualizer>
        <p>
        David Jay addressed an underlying problem that I had not even considered, and that is the PDF, "We need to kill the PDF. <b>So long as science is wrapped up in little stories that are difficult to link and difficult to extract the data from, it's going to be very difficult to make it readable to a range of audiences.</b>"  
        </p>
        <p>
        Before PDF aficionados jump on the defense and suggest trying alternative PDF viewers, allow me to first express praise for what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">Portable Document Format</a> has done for us. Thanks to the PDF, a dense and concise story with objective data that has been rigorously peer-reviewed by experts in the field is storable, searchable, and sharable. The invention of the PDF was a fantastic step forward for printing. All we're saying is that it shouldn't be the last! 
        </p>
        <p>
        The problem goes deeper than the PDF really, to the very concept of printing as a best practice for disseminating information. The very act of printing removes the document from an online network. Any critiques or accolades bestowed on the printed document must be outside the document, themselves printed documents on which printed responses can be written. In the current instantiation of each writing as its own independent object, the result is an arboreal pile, separate documents branching like a tree, with many limbs out of reach or even sight when reading the original document at the base of the trunk. <i>If we accept that comments on the original are important additions, be they criticisms, suggestions, or thoughts on the work's implications, then we should want those addenda to be as visible and searchable as the work itself.</i> After all, what a loss it would be if when experts took the time to foment and share their opinions, very few knew where to find them. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Yet this is arguably our current standard. Worse, a seemingly arbitrary and heavily tolled gate often guards the trunk of this tree we so want to explore. With the Internet, it is now cheap and easy to publish dynamic documents, like this one, so why do we still have archaic printing and access problems for primary literature? There are movements promoting alternative scholarly communication "Beyond the PDF", and I encourage you to read the <a href="http://www.force11.org/white_paper">manifesto of Force 11</a> (Future of Research communication and e-Scholarship) for a detailed account of changes that are being implemented for outdated modes of communication that impede accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
        On a more interactive platform, like what we see on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> and <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a> for example, an open discussion would enable researchers and collaborators to learn from one another and have the branches that emerge be easy to find and follow. We can and should have dynamic and interesting interactions with primary literature. <a href="http://www.journallab.org/">Journal Lab</a> is one example of the emerging market working to enable this. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners Lee</a> originally published his proposal for <a href="http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">dynamic information management</a> in March 1989, within which he introduces the idea of linked information systems, and compares them with the less flexible ways of finding information.* Just last month he <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21185853">"Predicts a Dynamic Web Future"</a> in this recorded interview with BBC News. He addresses the caveats of open web platforms, considering for example that different countries will likely establish different ethical standards. Although the World Wide Web was initially established for academic exchange, Sir Tim Berners Lee emphasizes that it should be for anything legal and ethical.
        </p>
        <p>
        *Thank you, Marten Lohstroh at Universiteit van Amsterdam, for sharing this exciting article with me. It serves as a reminder that <b>the ideas proposed here are far from original</b>. We have advanced a great deal in the past three decades, and it's time to bring these visions to the discussion table once more. These advances have enabled the Internet to host this information (and allow our overseas exchange of discourse)!

    <section class=contextualizer>
        <p>
        The following is a schematic for the potential future of scientific discourse and education. In this future, researchers and groups are no longer confined to work through the entire process relatively isolated from others. Instead the structure can be moved around freely, allowing researchers to find different niches in the system and potentially contribute in specific capacities across many projects rather than necessarily in all capacities for the limited few with which they are identified. It is an open structure that does not confine but encourages exploration:

            <p>
            For the MCB15 course, the organizers defined public as anyone outside of your field. David Jay elaborates, "That includes people trained in other fields, policymakers, everyday consumers, etc. The question that I'm most excited about is this: <b>how do you make it easy for experts from outside fields</b> (be they [immunology] or DC politics) <b>to access the discourse in your field? Making that easier will open up a lot of new possibilities.</b>" Prof. Full descibed examples of these new possibilities, see Collective Human Intelligence.

            "They call it a co-opetition rather than a competition," Prof. Full described <a href="http://fold.it/portal/">Fold-It</a>, which is an interactive game using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing</a> to fold amino acid chains into low-energy state protein conformations. "They created proteins that were more effective than the top biophysicists...they were working in a limited space...when they opened it up to the public-they were people with exceptional abilities in different areas. Hang-on, in terms of the future. I have no idea where this is going!" We can predict that the success of open source models will be incentivized, promoting greater collaboration between researchers and the public, as previously defined.
            </p>
            <p>
            The same principle can be applied in both academic and non-academic education infrastructures: "I think a lot of good teaching is about taking things that are really, really hard and breaking them down into bite-size interesting chunks that anyone can do," adds David Jay:"There's a whole movement out there called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science">citizen science</a>, where scientists are taking their complex research they have to do and breaking it down into chucks where you don't have to be a post-doc in molecular biology to do them...<b>research and teaching to begin to interact in really meaningful ways</b>."

        <header>Reward Structure</header>
        <section>
            <p>
            "Incentives are changing, and the way that people want to communicate with one another is also changing," adds David Jay. He introduces a familiar biological term into the discourse of collaboration: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-pollination#Mechanics">cross-pollination</a>. This involves the merging of parental genetic material into a hybrid that is unique from each of its predecessors. In the biological context, this increases the biodiversity of phenotypes and makes a community more sustainable and minimizes intraspecific (within species) competition. Apply this philosophy in applied academic collaborations: "If we can bake that love of cross-pollination into the incentives system that drives science, then there's a lot of power there."
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>"For me, science is about changing the world,"</b> Prof. Harris shares, "Working together is really fun, and I work with people I like, and it's really good...but then it's, Okay, who is first author on the paper? Right now, everyone likes that idea, and at the end of the call we're all going, 'Ooh, that's so cool!'" swells Prof. Harris, "I have to think about my post-docs or graduate students. They're going to need papers out of this. How are we going to fashion this so that this group effort ends up with what they need also, because we are in flux. Some things are ahead of other things...<b>If you want to play outside the system, it's not as forgiving</b>." On changing the reward structure, she speculates, "<i>It's not simple.</i>"
            </p>
            <p>
            Prof. Full discusses tenure evaluation in the context of the reward structure. Why is this person not selected to be the leader in the field for an international, inter-disciplinary collaboration? Once this style of evaluation starts to happen, the reward structure will change. It ties in with industry and education as well. "When I started, self-promotion wasn't a big thing...now you're required to communicate. If you don't communicate outside of your discipline...people won't know who you are." Prof. Full harnesses the dissemination power of TED talks to communicate broadly, beyond collaborators and to the general public. By engaging the public in his subject of expertise more broadly, Prof. Full ameliorates public understanding.

        <header>Tools and Motivation for Increasing Accessibility: Feedback and Feedforward</header>
        <section>
            <p>
            Think of it like <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>. Businesses read reviews from customers in order to improve their business practices (i.e. feedback). Reviewers can rank each other's reviews as useful (i.e. feedback on the feedback). Other start-up businesses can learn what customers need and fulfill a new niche in the local business ecology instead of entering as competition (i.e. feedforward). A similarly engaging and interesting possibility lies in the ability for students and the public to CONTRIBUTE to real scientific discourse at any level, from background to dissemination! We have the technology to make interaction with scientific literature both engaging and productive.
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> is an example of how groups of people can share dynamic interactions with documents; however, PDFs as they are currently designed cannot be altered on this platform without passing through another medium. Also, you have to directly invite others to have access to the content that is uploaded, and it is unlikely that your list of invitees includes everyone in the world that would find your discourse useful. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="http://www.journallab.org/">Journal Lab</a> is a model platform that can be implemented in the classroom, and students can share feedback with everyone who interacts with research through this platform. <b>"Not just what journals you published in but how much that research is getting talked about online by other scientists, or how much youíve really been a part of these collaborations, and as those alternative metrics become more and more a part of the way that people get jobs and people get funding to do their research, I think that things are going to change a lot,"</b> adds David Jay in the panel discussion

        The backbone of this model, for the potential future of scientific discourse and education, bridges the gap between experts in the field and the public on an open source interface. </p><p>
        <b>Feedback can be provided by anyone at any scale. </b></p><p>
        It is cost-effective and productive. Constructive feedback is ranked as useful by the community, and the contributors of it are incentivized. There are no closed doors, and filters are at the researchers' discretion. Search engines allow the public to engage at a customized level and depth.
        Ideally, the entire process, from background discussion through dissemination, is transparent. The public (students included) actively engages and contributes to advancements in the field.

    <header>Education: The Interface</header>
    <aside>
	The following section on education considers possible avenues for students to self-promote while engaging in scientific discourse. If you are passionate about education, and you have not yet experienced the narration of Sir Ken Robinson visualized by RSAnimate, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U">Changing Education Paradigms</a>, take 11 minutes and 41 seconds for some thought-provoking perspective on the topic.

        The Future of Science panel appropriately addressed the changes envisioned for education: "I have worked on both the research end of the collaborations as well as the education end," starts Prof. Full, "We argue that you have to train people explicitly to do this‚Ä¶<b><i>Interdisciplinary training is required</i></b>. We first made a big mistake in doing it, which is we said, "You all have to do all the disciplines. You know, you're a biologist, [so] you have to know something about math, something about chemistry" ¶That was a total failure. Although you're a very interesting person, you're a jack of all trades, master of none. You can't contribute to any inter-disciplinary collaboration, and so you're not valuable.‚Äù Prof. Full shares the concept of <b>mutualistic teaming</b>, where students training in different fields can translate curiosity-based discovery into real products: ‚ÄúYou have a deep expertise, but we explicitly teach you how to contribute to and benefit from the other discipline.‚Äù Prof. Full motivates biologists and engineers to work together in a teaching lab to do original research. ‚ÄúLast year we had one of those studies in the teaching lab end up on the cover of <i>Nature</i>, so we‚Äôre really convinced that this is a good model.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>The unification of research and teaching stimulates exploration and discovery</b>, instead of evaluating content memorization and delivery (engorgement and regurgitation).
        </p>
        <p>
        The scientific publication cycle (as aforementioned) shows how education in our current model has only a superficial and passive interaction with this process. Before the university level, students have limited access to textbooks, i.e. classical texts of modern education systems. Most texts synthesize background information and present it as dogma. <i>Students highlight and summarize, separating themselves from the text the way tourists superficially engage with their surroundings through a camera lens, disengaging from the opportunity to experience a new culture.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        Some college courses promote critical thinking. Students begin to gain access to the primary peer-reviewed literature and think critically about it. After students struggle to re-digest the predigested PDF, great discussions and critiques come out of these courses. Students should be encouraged to share their 'reviews' on an open-interface, where other students and researchers can learn from one another.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>This allows academic 'peer-review' and learning to interact in meaningful ways.</b> (See Feedback and Feedforward section for additional details)
        </p>
        <p>
        <b> A similar interface can be implemented at any grade level as a meta-pedagogical* practice.</b> Why not have 3rd graders share with one another their questions for the science fair project before they even start it, and reflect on their progress along the way? Teachers can archive these projects, and future students can repeat experiments (replication) or address questions that were left unanswered by the work of previous students, building on a pre-existing discourse. <i>Students can individually build digital portfolios, and this practice can extend through the high school level.</i> Why not have students share the theses statements of their English essays on an open source, and students can provide incentivized feedback for one another along the way? Students that share a similar interest can delve into a topic together and collaborate to produce an essay to be included in their public portfolio. <i>This portfolio can become a foundation for meaningful discourse at university-level academic engagement.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        Teachers are confronted regularly with a question that only brave, impugning students put forward: "What's the point?" While we could dance around an answer that entertains the idea of, "You will learn from this experience, so you can one day engage in a meaningful discourse," <b>I propose that students be given the opportunity to actively engage and contribute to the academic discourse now.</b> Students want to have a purpose, and we have the technology to enable it, so what are we waiting for?
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Noteworthy Examples:</b> 
        <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Kahn Academy</a> allows for Questions, Feedback, and Spin-Offs, and Documentation. Other form of <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">OpenCourseWare</a> and Online Certification are available, promoting, "open sharing of knowledge." (MIT OpenCourseWare)

        <p>
    The conceived concept of an <i>idea</i> as something that is made and shared with the community, instead of being had and owned by an individual, is an important consideration. There exists an element of scarcity imbedded in the notion of ownership. We want to increase our self-worth as much as possible because in our system, as it stands, our <i>value</i> is assessed by the people deciding to whom these limited resources (money and jobs) will be partitioned. An idea does not have value, however, until others attribute value to it. An idea gains value the more it is disseminated and developed. From it can the fruiting bodies of tangible data, products, and other new ideas grow. 
        </p>
        <p>
    <b>We are imbedded in a world constructed from the ideas of others</b>, from the computers we use to the words we abuse. Collectively, we would not be where we are today if these resources, designed and shared by others, were not available. Aspects of how we currently disseminate knowledge in academia delay use of new ideas and resources by others, and this stalled feedback impedes progress. Peer-review is a meaningful advancement that maintains the quality of disseminated knowledge, so acclaimed experts in the field who have survived the process themselves can preserve this system. We can consider sharing data and ideas in real-time instead and build on the very necessary concept of peer-review with modern technology, riffing on proofs-of-concept like Khan Academy and Wikipedia as <i>real-time, self-organizing drivers of content review, increasingly proving to be sources of meaningful feedback</i>. Technology is enabling us to open source ideas and data as resources for others, and this is definitely a step in the right direction. Some may express concern that not everyone is qualified to review an experiment. <i>Unique questions and perspectives from those who share interests in the field, especially if they come from outside the field, could lead to novel and exciting developments, or could fill time with banal "insights". Is this a good enough excuse to avoid trying? Finding how to manage a balance is part of this process, and we are all involved.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
    It is often said that great things are reached by standing on the shoulders of giants. We need to start thinking about how to hoist the most people up onto those shoulders. If we all benefit from better science and faster progress, and if we can use technology to make the hoisting process as easy and painless as possible, then maybe we can overcome some of the limits put in place by our current insular, short-term competition model. It's worth pushing for, because while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a> explains the emergence of competition as we know it, it also demonstrates the <b><i>co-opetition brings all the players to a higher score on average</i></b>. Aspects of our current reward structure acknowledge mere individuals, imposing competition and clamoring that will only keep our community at a ground-level stalemate. It would be more productive for communities, not individuals, to receive accolades for their accomplishments. <b>The problem going forward is finding ways to restructure insentive so that the individuals that make up our communities want to help each other more and fight each other less.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        Imagine a socio-ecologically balanced system of co-evolving engineers and biologists, chemists and computer scientists, astrophysicists and artists, and interplay between the groups of these experts, all sharing an objective vernacular and each contributing to the development and dissemination of novel ideas and discoveries. Across groups, there are sub-groups collecting data, others interpreting raw data with diverse statistical and intellectual analyses, storytellers that take these analyses and describe them with narrations, novelists that weave the stories together with cross-disciplinary comparisons, and performers that symbolically reinterpret these stories and uniquely transform them in ways that strengthen the links in this non-linear, rhizomatic chain, even making new and constructive kinks in the links. This is the future of science as we see it, and maybe, dare I be so blunt, humanity-if we are lucky.
