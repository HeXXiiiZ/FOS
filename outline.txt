    ...

(D) Why this is not being adopted: Psychoanalysis?
  ** Here I am going to unleash some Zizek **
  (1) It's not the tool, fool. (Tool fetishization)
    (a) Defensive fetishistic disavowal of the real problem.
    (b) Those in power want academics to busy themselves 'tooling around'. 
  (2) Reward structures, professorship, ... a prisoners' dilemma 
    (a) We cannot use our ideals about what people should need
        to dismiss people's wants.
    (b) Explicit rules / Implicit rules. 
  (3) Fear of the Unconscious (My psychoanalytic proposition)
      ** This is where I think a good argument can be made **
      ** People fear the big Other seeing their non-idealistic reality ** 
    



Freud on Communism and Christianity ....

The ideals of Science are:
  * Universality
  * Skepticism
  * Communism
  * Disinterestedness

This ideal of Science allows no room for the scientists themselves.
  * Diversity/Subjectivity
  * Belief/Intuition
  * Individualism/Recognition
  * Passion/Interest

The ideals of Science are in conflict with Scientists.
They constitute a demand impossible to fulfill.

Freud Quote, 
Chapter 5 Civ/Dis on Communism (p71)
Chapter 7 Civ/Dis on Christianity (p109)


The ideals of Science become the superego or Big Other of its community, while on the level of individual researchers basic wants demand satisfaction. An Ego in the scientific community forms to mediate this conflict between the Idistic desires of scientists as people in communities and the Idealistic expectations of the community as a whole. The Ego mediates by presenting a satisfying image to the Ideals while at the same time securing the satisfaction of desires. This splitting in the Ego keeps the two forces of drives and superegoistic injunctions at bay. 

What do scientists want?
* To continue to do science.
  ** With a decent standard of living.
  ** With a amicable social environment.
  ** But, there is a scarcity of opportunity.
* To be respected/recognized.
  ** But, there is only so room for recognition.
